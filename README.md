1 Understanding the client's business model and KPIs

2 Gathering, cleaning, and preparing social media data

3 Building a data model and designing intuitive visuals

4 Analyzing content categories and engagement patterns

Extracting actionable business insights for strategic decision-making

2 Translated stakeholder requirements into measurable metrics

3 Created custom insights beyond the provided brief

4 Delivered a user-friendly dashboard for executive review
